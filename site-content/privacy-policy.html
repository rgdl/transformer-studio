    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    <h3>Effective December 12th, 2023</h3>
    <p>Some of our apps are funded by in-app advertisements, so that they can be kept free to download. This requires the transmission of some data about your Android device to ad networks (e.g. device ID, OS version, IP address). No more data is sent than is necessary for ads to load, and the data is encrypted in transit. We do not retain any of this data for our own purposes.</p>
